What is RAG?
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
It is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) with facts fetched from external sources.
In simple terms, RAG gives LLMs "open-book" access to information, rather than forcing them to rely on "closed-book" memorized knowledge.

How does RAG work?
There are two main phases:
1. Indexing: A knowledge base (like a set of documents) is loaded, split into chunks, converted into vectors (embeddings), and stored in a vector database.
2. Retrieval and Generation: When a user asks a query, the system first retrieves relevant chunks from the database. Then, these chunks are passed to the LLM, along with the user's query, to generate a well-founded answer.
